# Extending vHeap

All you need to do to extend is take a look at the [extended.js](https://github.com/wes4m/vheap/blob/master/vheapViews/static/js/extended.js) file.
Extensions are based on callbacks. 

The file also includes a few examples to follow.
The double free detecton and overlap detecetion showed in the demo are made as extension functionallites.
